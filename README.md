# bu-shuttle-mobile

## About
This is a mobile application for iOS and Android devices that focuses on a tighter and more streamlined tracking experience of the Boston University shuttle buses. Built with Google's Flutter mobile UI framework. 

I conceived the idea during February of 2017 and have been working on it since May 2018, along with the accompanying [web app](https://github.com/ctrinh98/bu-shuttle). (2017-2018)

## Features
- [x] Main page with two bus arrival estimates per stop
- [x] Colored arrival estimate indicators based on time
- [x] Bus stop detail page with information about stop
- [ ] Photos for every stop detail page (almost done!)
- [ ] Descriptions for every stop detail page
- [x] Bus schedule implemented for every stop
- [x] Fluid animations for stop details page
- [x] Create app icon
- [ ] Create splash screen

## Progress
Unfortuntely, BU IS&T has requested that this app not be published due to the fact that it is not officially maintained by the university. No more progress will be made from this point on.
